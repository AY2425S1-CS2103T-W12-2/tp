## Quick Start

Let's get you started with VolunSync! Just follow these simple steps:

1. **Check if You Have Java**
   First, let's make sure your computer has Java 17 or newer:
    - Open your computer's command window:
        - On Windows: Press the Windows key and 'R' together, type `cmd`, and press Enter
        - On Mac/Linux: Find and open "Terminal" in your Applications
    - Type this command: `java -version`
    - If you see something like `java version "17.x.x"` or higher, you're ready to go!
    - If not:
        - Visit [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) to get Java 17
        - Follow their simple installation steps
    - After installing, check again with `java -version` to make sure it worked

2. **Get VolunSync**
    - Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/releases)
    - Put the downloaded file in any folder where you'd like to keep VolunSync

3. **Start VolunSync**
    - Open your computer's command window
    - Type `cd` and the location of your VolunSync folder

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Command Format Guidelines

**:information_source: Helpful Tips for Using Commands:**

Let's go over some simple guidelines that will help you use VolunSync easily:

* When you see `UPPERCASE` words, that's where you'll put your own information.
  For example, in `n/NAME`, you might type `n/John Doe`

* Don't worry about the order! If a command asks for `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you can type them in any order:
  `p/91234567 n/John Doe` works just as well

* Square brackets `[ ]` mean optional items.
  For example, in an event description [des/DESCRIPTION], you can skip it if you don't need it

* No need to worry about extra spaces at the start or end of your typing - VolunSync handles that for you

* When counting characters (like for names or descriptions), spaces count too:
<pre>
 "AB"   = 2 characters
 "A B"  = 3 characters
 "A  B" = 4 characters
</pre>

* Simple commands like `help` will work even if you accidentally type extra things after them

## General Commands

### Viewing Help : `help`

Need a hand? Just type `help` to open this guide in your web browser. You can also click the help button at the top of the window or press the F1 key.

Format: `help`

![Getting Help](images/VolunSyncUiShowHelpButton.png)

### Listing All Activities : `list`


Want to see everyone and everything? The `list` command shows all your volunteers and events. It's especially useful after you've been searching or filtering - it brings back the full view.

Format: `list`

![Full View](images/VolunSyncUi.png)

### Saving Records : `export`

Need to share your records or print them out? The `export` command saves everything into easy-to-read files.

Format: `export`


After using this command:
1. Look for a new folder called `/output` where you keep VolunSync
2. You'll find two files:
    - `events.csv` - All your event information
    - `volunteers.csv` - All your volunteer information

![Exported Files](images/ExportCommand.png)

### Closing the Program : `exit`


Ready to finish up? Just type `exit` to close VolunSync safely.

Format: `exit`

## Managing Your Volunteers

### Adding a New Volunteer: `/v new`

Welcome a new volunteer to your team!

Format: `/v new n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER em/EMAIL d/AVAILABLE_DATE`

What you'll need:
- Name: Letters, numbers, and spaces (up to 100 characters)
- Phone Number: Just numbers (3-15 digits)
- Email: Standard email format (like name@email.com)
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD (like 2024-01-01)

![Adding a Volunteer](images/NewVolunteer.png)

### Finding Someone: `/v find`

Looking for a particular volunteer? This command helps you find them by name.

Format: `/v find KEYWORD`

Tips:
* It doesn't matter if you use capital or small letters
* It finds parts of names too - typing "Tan" can find "Stanley" or "Tanya"
* If no one is found, you'll see all volunteers again

Example:
* `/v find ng` returns `David Ng`, `Alice Wong` and `Jason Wang`

![Finding Volunteers](images/commandDemo/FindVolunteerDemo.png)

### Removing a Volunteer: `/v del`

When a volunteer leaves, you can remove their record.

Format: `/v del INDEX`

* The INDEX is the number you see next to their name in the list
* Use `list` first if you need to see everyone's numbers

Example:
* `/v del 2` removes the second volunteer from your list

![Removing a Volunteer](images/commandDemo/DeleteVolunteerDemo.png)

### Adding Available Dates: `/v free`

Update when a volunteer is available to help.

Format: `/v free INDEX d/DATES`

* Use the number (INDEX) next to the volunteer's name
* For multiple dates, separate them with commas
* Use YYYY-MM-DD format (like 2024-01-01)

Example:
* `/v free 1 d/2024-10-28, 2024-10-29`

![Adding Dates](images/commandDemo/FreeVolunteerDemo.png)

### Removing Available Dates: `/v unfree`

Need to mark dates when a volunteer isn't available anymore?

Format: `/v unfree INDEX d/DATES`

Example:
* `/v unfree 1 d/2024-10-28, 2024-10-29`

![Removing Dates](images/commandDemo/UnfreeVolunteerDemo.png)

### Signing Up for Events: `assign`

Connect volunteers with events they'd like to join.

Format: `assign v/VOLUNTEER_INDEX e/EVENT_INDEX`

* Use the numbers shown next to both the volunteer and event names
* The system checks if the volunteer is free on that date
* It also makes sure they aren't already signed up for another event at the same time

Example:
* `assign v/3 e/2` signs up volunteer #3 for event #2

![Signing Up](images/commandDemo/AssignVolunteerDemo.png)

### Withdrawing from Events: `unassign`

If a volunteer needs to step back from an event:

Format: `unassign v/VOLUNTEER_INDEX e/EVENT_INDEX`

Example:
* `unassign v/2 e/2`

![Withdrawing](images/commandDemo/UnassignVolunteerDemo.png)

### Checking a Volunteer's Schedule: `/v view`

Want to see which events a volunteer is joining? This command shows you everything they're signed up for.

Format: `/v view INDEX`

* Just use the number (INDEX) you see next to their name in the list
* After you're done, type `list` to see everyone again

Example:
* `/v view 1` shows all the events your first volunteer is helping with

![Viewing Schedule](images/commandDemo/ViewVolunteerDemo.png)

## Managing Your Events

### Creating a New Event: `/e new`

Planning a new activity? Here's how to add it to VolunSync.

What you'll need:

- Location: Where it's happening (up to 100 characters)
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD (like 2024-01-01)

- End Time: 24-hour format (like 17:00 for 5 PM)
- Description: Optional - add any helpful details (up to 100 characters)

Examples:

![Adding an Event](images/commandDemo/NewEventDemo.png)

### Finding an Event: `/e find`

Looking for a particular event? This command helps you find it by name.

Format: `/e find KEYWORD`

Tips:
* Don't worry about capital or small letters
* It finds partial matches too - typing "food" can find "Food Drive" or "Seafood Party"
* If nothing matches, you'll see all events again

Example:
* `/e find beach` returns `Beach Cleanup` and `beach clean2`

![Finding Events](images/commandDemo/FindEventDemo.png)

### Canceling an Event: `/e del`

Example:
* `/e del 2` removes the second event from your list

![Removing an Event](images/commandDemo/DeleteEventDemo.png)

### Checking Event Attendance: `/e view`

Want to see who's coming to an event?

Format: `/e view INDEX`

* Use the number (INDEX) next to the event name
* Type `list` afterwards to see everything again

Example:
* `/e view 1` shows all volunteers signed up for your first event

![Viewing Attendance](images/commandDemo/ViewDemo.png)

### Finding Available Helpers: `/e filter`

Need to find volunteers who are free for a specific event?

Format: `/e filter INDEX`

* Use the number (INDEX) next to the event name
* This shows only volunteers who:
    - Are available on that day
    - Aren't already busy with another event
    - Haven't signed up for this event yet

Example:
* `/e filter 1` shows all volunteers who could help with your first event

## Saving Your Work

Don't worry about saving - VolunSync automatically saves everything you do! Every change you make is safely stored on your computer.

## Common Questions

**Q**: Oops! Can I undo something I just did?
**A**: Not yet, but we're working on adding an 'undo' feature in our next update. Stay tuned!

## Technical Issues

1. **Using Multiple Screens?**
   If you move VolunSync to a second screen and later disconnect it:
    - The program might open off-screen next time
    - To fix this, just find and delete the `preferences.json` file
    - Start VolunSync again, and it'll open on your main screen

2. **Help Window Stays Hidden?**
   If you minimize the help window and can't get it back:
    - Look for it in your taskbar and click to bring it back up
    - Or close it completely and type `help` again

We're always working to make VolunSync better and easier to use. Keep an eye out for updates!
