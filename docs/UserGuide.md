VolunSync is a **desktop app for keeping track of volunteers and volunteering events, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, VolunSync can get your event and personnel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your VolunSync application.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar volunsync.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the User Guide on your browser.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `reset` : Lists all volunteers and events in the VolunSync database.

   * `/v new n/ John Doe p/ 91234567 em/ john@gmail.com d/ 2024-02-02 s/ 00:10 e/ 23:59` : Creates a new record for a volunteer named `John Doe` to the VolunSync database.

   * `/v del 3` : Deletes the third volunteer on the list of volunteers.

   * `/e new n/ Coding Exam s/ 19:00 e/ 21:00 d/ 2024-12-12 l/ LT 28` : Creates a new record for an event named `Coding Exam` to the VolunSync database.

   * `/e del 3` : Deletes the third event from the list of events.

   * `reset` : Displays all volunteers and events in the database.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `des/ DESCRIPTION`

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `reset` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: Can I undo an action that I just made?<br>
**A**: Currently VolunSync does not support the `undo` function, but we are planning to implement it in the future so stay tuned for the update!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
